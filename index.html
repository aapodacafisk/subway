      <h2>THE BEST SANDWICHES IN INTERALE, NEW HAMPSHIRE</h2>
      <p>Upon entering your Subway establishment in Intervale New Hampshire on June 28th around 5:30 PM I was not impressed the store was extremely dirty and when I went up to the counter to order I was not impressed by the looks of the food lots of cross contamination. Even though that was the case I was hungry so I ordered as I was ordering the associate making my sandwich was quite aware of the way the food looked but did not attempt to exchange the food that was cross contaminated and he also did not make the sandwich correctly he inundated the sandwich with way too many pickles and mayo. I then again even though was going to purchase it but found out that they could only take cash when both associates rudely stated that there was signs all over the door stating this. I was also set back by the price they quoted me for a meal which was 20+ dollars. Even though I was going to grab cash and as I was walking back to my vehicle to do so thought about all the red flags prior to this such as dirty, rude and cross cotamination ect. I decided to go to the Subway in N. Conway NH instead. As I was relaxing with a friend outside after I had eaten the associate showed up at the store (William Shaw) " Stated I take it you are not coming back for your sandwich" I concured with him and he stated " Do not come back to the store" I said okay. As he walked into the store he was conversing with the associate inside the store in front of everyone about his version of what had just occurred. I was upset so I did walk in to explain when he walked to his car but come to find out this is not the first time with this establishment or this employee that there has been an issue per the associate that i was speaking with at the North Conway establishment. He then walked back in as i was talking and i wanted to speak with a manager and come to find out this William Shaw that is not cleanly looking at all is the manager i was mortified to say the least. I then thought instead of dealing with him i would contact coporate and explain. As i was sitting outside with a friend he was still being very confrontational and taking pictures of me without my permission. My friend went up to the window to see if she could locate the number for coporate and he came out to confront her. Stating "If you need anything just ask me" I stated the number to coporate. He went back in the store and came back out on the phone with someone and stated to look the number up on the internet which I did. This is not the first time this employee has caused issues nor is it the first time someone has complained about cleanliness or the price that they are being charged at this establishment, Especially when I ordered at the North Conway store the entire order came out to 14 dollars and some change huge difference. Something needs to be done on this matter because myself and my friends will not be visiting any subway establishment until this is addressed. Hard times I know but not that hard to tarnish the subway name anymore that it has already been.
